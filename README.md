# Rock-or-Mine-Classification
This project uses Logistic Regression to classify sonar data, distinguishing between rocks and mines. It reads data from a CSV, separates features and labels, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains the model, evaluates accuracy, and predicts outcomes based on input sonar readings.
